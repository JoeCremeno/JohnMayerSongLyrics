No Such Thing

By John Mayer

"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and whute
Well I never lived the dreams or the prom kings
And the Drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better 
On the other side

I wang go run throught the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books, but ehy can't find the answers
And all of our parent's, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

They love to tell you 
Stay inside the lines
But something's better 
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for
